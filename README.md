## 🔍 Overview

Powered by the Full-Text RSS API, Springboard is the most comprehensive and effective shortcut to bypass paywalls and access restricted content online!
In addition to its primary functionality of extracting articles, Springboard is also highly customizable and includes features for translating and summarizing* articles.
Much like ad blockers, bypass (or "article extraction") tools are now a necessity as online news & media outlets continue to lock more and more content behind paywalls.
<br />
*Feature currently in testing to be included in v4.0 which is set to release in early August 2024.
